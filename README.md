# Developer Project Index

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partial list of personal software-development projects I'm keeping temporarily until I can merge it into [my 'Developer Sandbox'](https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Developer-Sandbox).  

## Projects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects I currently have at least some investment in are:  

 - [My 'Semantic Looseleaf Workspace' format](https://gitlab.com/semantic-looseleaf-workspace):  

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate a workspace that lets you organize your creative endeavors using YAML front matter.  

   - [Specification](https://gitlab.com/semantic-looseleaf-workspace/specification)
   - [Tooling](https://gitlab.com/semantic-looseleaf-workspace/tooling)
   - [Template Repository](https://gitlab.com/semantic-looseleaf-workspace/template-repository)

   _Status:_  **Sees Occasional Updates** (I hack on it a bit now and again.)  
 - '[portage-brew](https://github.com/portage-brew/brew)'

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Homebrew, the 'missing packager for macOS,' but for those who prefer to build directly from source.  

   _Status:_  **In Development Purgatory** (Outstanding pull requests do see not-infrequent rebasing on top of upstream changes, though.)  

   (Assistance welcome/help wanted.)
